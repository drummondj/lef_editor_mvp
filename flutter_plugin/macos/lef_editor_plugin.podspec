# le_*() (see ../src/lef_editor_plugin.h) is implemented in
# backend/src/api/api.cpp, not in this plugin's own sources - link the
# backend's own CMake build output directly rather than recompiling it
# here. This link recipe is a manual mirror of backend/CMakeLists.txt's
# `api`/`render`/`io`/`skia` targets (there's no automated sharing between
# a CMakeLists.txt and a podspec) - keep the two in sync by hand; see this
# plugin's CLAUDE.md.
#
# Deliberately backend/build_release (Release), not backend/build (Debug)
# - this plugin is what an actual running Flutter app embeds, so it needs
# real optimized performance, not debug-build timings. backend/build
# (Debug) still has to exist too, for backend's own ctest/development
# workflow - both trees are expected to be kept up to date going forward,
# not just Release-on-demand for benchmarking. See this plugin's CLAUDE.md
# and backend/CLAUDE.md's Build section.
#
# CocoaPods loads this podspec through a `.symlinks/plugins/...` path, not
# this file's real location - File.realpath resolves that symlink first,
# or the relative walk below lands inside .symlinks instead of the repo.

# render-path code), le_tcl only interprets a handful of typed commands
# per keystroke, so Debug-build overhead here is irrelevant, and this
# avoids needing le_tcl added to the Release tree at all. Same Tcl 8.6
