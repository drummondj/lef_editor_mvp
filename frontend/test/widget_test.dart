// Plain widget test - MyApp is given a LeProvider built on FakeLeEditor
// (test/fakes/fake_le_editor.dart), which has no FFI/MethodChannel calls
// anywhere in its call graph, so this proves the Dart-side widget tree
// builds and lays out correctly, not that reading a real LEF file
// actually works end to end against the real native plugin. That's what
// integration_test/read_lef_test.dart is for instead - see its own header
// comment for why a plain widget test structurally cannot cover that even
// with a real LeEditor (MethodChannel calls are intercepted by Flutter's
// test binding by default, never reaching real native code) - and why
// merely constructing a real LeEditor crashes under plain `flutter test`
// in the first place (see LeEditorBase's own doc comment).
