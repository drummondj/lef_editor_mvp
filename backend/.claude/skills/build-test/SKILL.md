# Build and test the backend

1. **Configure and build:**

   ```
   cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   cmake --build build -j
   ```

2. **Run tests via ctest:**

   ```
   ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
   ```

3. **Also keep `build_release/` (Release) up to date**, not just `build/`
   (Debug) - `flutter_plugin/macos/lef_editor_plugin.podspec` links
   `build_release`'s `api`/`render`/`io` output directly (a real running
   Flutter app needs actual optimized performance, not debug-build
   timings - see the podspec's own comment), so it's a persistent tree
   now, not a throwaway benchmarking artifact:

   ```
   cmake -S . -B build_release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build build_release --target api render io -j
   ```

   Rebuild both trees after a backend source change if `flutter_plugin`/
   `frontend` work is in play, the same way `build/` gets rebuilt before
   `ctest`. `build_release/` is `.gitignore`d, same as `build/`.

5. **Dependencies**: `spdlog`, `fmt`, `Boost` via `find_package` (installed
   via Homebrew on this dev machine); GoogleTest via CMake `FetchContent`
   (no system install needed); `src/lefdef/lef` (vendored LEF parser C
   source) built via `ExternalProject_Add` + its own `Makefile`.

6. **If `lef_lib` fails to build** with something like
   `ranlib: liblef.a is not writable` or `mv: lef.tab.c: No such file or
   directory`: that vendored Makefile's `install`/`release` targets race
   under a parallel jobserver. `CMakeLists.txt` already forces the
   `ExternalProject_Add(lef_lib ...)` step to run with
   `--unset=MAKEFLAGS make -j1` — if this regresses, check that flag hasn't
   been dropped rather than reaching for `-j1` on the whole outer build.

7. Report build/test failures concisely — file:line and the actual error,
   not the full compiler log. Per this project's requirements, benchmark
   before changing anything for performance reasons rather than guessing.

8. **Coverage** (line + branch, off by default): reconfigure with
   `-DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON`, then `cmake --build build --target coverage`.
   Prints a `llvm-cov report --show-branch-summary` table and writes
   `build/coverage/lcov.info`. Requires Clang + `llvm-profdata`/`llvm-cov`
   (auto-resolved via `xcrun` on macOS). See CLAUDE.md's "Coverage" section
   for the full explanation, including why `io` shows 0% until it has tests.
