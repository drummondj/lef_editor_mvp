#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Assembles a rootless build toolchain for this repo on Rocky Linux 8 (or
# any dnf/RPM-based RHEL-8-family distro) with no root access and no
# ability to install system packages. Idempotent/rerunnable - each stage
# checks whether its own output already exists and skips if so, so a
# failed run can just be re-invoked after fixing whatever broke.
#
# Neither this script nor the plan it came from has been run against a
# real Rocky 8 machine - every RPM name, URL, and GN flag below is
# best-effort reasoning grounded in this repo's own actual CMake/GN files
# and general RHEL8 package knowledge, not empirical verification. Expect
# real failures; each stage below prints exactly what it was trying to do
# so a failure is easy to report back and iterate on, the same way this
# project's own Docker/Ubuntu Linux CI path (Dockerfile.linux-ci) took
# several real iteration rounds to get working even on a much more
# forgiving (full apt access) base image.
#
# Usage:
#   backend/scripts/rocky8-bootstrap.sh [stage ...]
# With no arguments, runs every stage in order. Pass one or more stage
# names (see STAGE_NAMES below) to run only those, e.g. to retry a single
# failed stage:
#   backend/scripts/rocky8-bootstrap.sh skia
#
# After this completes, `source backend/scripts/rocky8-env.sh` before
# configuring the actual CMake/Flutter builds.
#
# Every run's full output is also written to a timestamped log file under
# $LE_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT/logs/ (see BUILD.md at the repo root) - if a stage
# fails and you can't work out why, that log file is exactly what's worth
# sending back for help; its path is printed at both the start and end of
# every run so it's easy to find either way.

# --- RPM extraction helper: downloads <pkg> (+ its full resolved

# call more than once for the same package - re-downloads are cheap and
# re-extraction is idempotent (cpio just overwrites the same files).
# Unconditional - always fetches/extracts regardless of what's already on
# the system. Only meant for packages where that's actually the right
# call (see extract_rpm_closure_if_missing below for the alternative, and
# stage_rpms's own comments for which packages need which): the compiler
# and CMake/Skia's own vendored-vs-system choices are pinned to a *known*
# version deliberately, because RHEL8's own stock versions of those are
# either too old to work at all (GCC 8.5 has no real C++20/23 support) or
# a real, specific version-skew risk already reasoned through elsewhere
# (RHEL8's harfbuzz/icu vs. a modern Skia commit) - "is something already
# installed" isn't a good enough question for those; the actual version
# matters, not just presence. ---
# RPM package names whose closure gets pulled in transitively by basically
# everything on a RHEL-family system (via "Requires: filesystem" et al) but
# that ship nothing this toolchain actually needs - only the base OS
# directory skeleton. Skipped entirely rather than extracted: `cpio -d`
# already creates whatever real parent directories the packages we *do*
# need require, on demand. `filesystem` specifically ships several legacy
# placeholder directories (/usr/lib{,64}/tls, sse2, debug, games, locale,
# modules, sysimage, X11, bpf, pm-utils) with an explicit, non-owner-writable
# mode baked into the RPM's own file list - cpio applies that literal mode
# on mkdir, so as a non-root user every subsequent attempt to create
# anything under those paths (even by the owning user) fails EACCES. Add
# another package name here if a future closure hits the same pattern.
