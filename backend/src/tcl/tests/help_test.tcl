# complete_command's dot-path completion is pure static schema metadata
# (::property_scalars/::property_hops), never a live query, so a
# friendly-id token like "shape:0" works fine as a completion seed even
# though no such Shape actually exists in an empty session.

# candidate that itself starts with that same unbalanced "{" is, for the
# same reason, not test-inspectable via `in`/`llength`/`lindex` (Tcl
# list operations - it isn't a well-formed list element on its own), so
# these compare complete_command's own result directly as a plain string
# via `check`, not list membership.
