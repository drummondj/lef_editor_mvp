# under the real compiled le_shell binary (not tclsh directly loading
# le_tcl - smoke_test.tcl/crud_test.tcl already cover that), so this is
# what actually exercises le_shell.cpp's own bootstrap: -module/-procs
# argv handling, `load`, and sourcing le_tcl_procs.tcl, before Tcl_Main
# hands control to this script. If any of that bootstrapping were broken,
# every command below would be an "invalid command name" error instead
# of running - CRUD/search correctness itself is crud_test.tcl's job, not
# this file's.

# argv (Tcl_Main's own script-argument convention, not this project's
# usual <module> <procs> <lef> triple - le_shell already consumed
# -module/-procs itself before Tcl_Main ever saw this script):
