# Thin -flag parsing layer over the SWIG-wrapped *_cmd shim functions
# (le_tcl_shim.hpp/.cpp) - Tcl's own `-flag value` calling convention has
# to be parsed here, since SWIG-wrapped C++ functions are always
# positional. See TCL_EXPLORATION.md's "Tcl ergonomics layer" section for
# why this split exists (C++ shim owns session state + command logic,
# Tcl owns flag parsing) rather than putting everything in one place.
# Sourced by anything that loads the le_tcl module and wants the
# ergonomic (item 15 -shaped) command surface rather than the raw *_cmd
# forms.
#
# Also owns every piece of Phase 5's CRUD/search surface that's better
# built in Tcl than in C++: property tables and search-result/shape-list
# aggregation (properties_for_token, shape_rects, ...) loop over the
# shim's plain count+by-index accessors and build a real Tcl dict/list
# with `dict set`/`lappend` - correct quoting by construction, unlike
# hand-rolled string-building in C++ (see le_tcl_shim.hpp's own
# "property tables and search results" comment for why that split was
# made). Coordinate lists themselves (`-points {x y x y ...}`) need no
# such treatment here - le_api.i's typemap already turns a plain Tcl list
# into the shim's (const double*, int32_t count) pair directly.

# --- Help system (UPDATES.md item 20) ---

# ::command_help maps a command name to a {usage <str> description <str>
# options <list>} dict - register_command_help below is the single write
# path, called once per command right after its own `proc` definition.
# Every generated command (get_<type>/create_<type>/update_<type>)
# registers itself from generated/le_tcl_procs_generated.tcl, sourced
# further down this file; every hand-written command below registers
# itself directly, right after its own definition. help/man/
# complete_command/generate_command_docs all read purely from this
# registry - none of them re-derive metadata by invoking a command with
# -help.
#
# An `options` entry is `{-flag {type T required R description {D}}}` (or
# `{<positional> {...}}` for a plain positional parameter, which
# documents the same way but is never treated as a `-`-flag by
# complete_command's own flag-completion branch, since it doesn't start
# with `-`). `required`/`type` are always present; `type` is a
# human-readable label only (e.g. "str"/"int"/"token"/"Point..."), not
# machine-validated here - real validation still happens inside each
# command's own body, same as before this system existed.

# would mean actually running a query while the user is still typing,

# Tcl_Eval's own string result - see flutter_plugin's LeTclConsole/
# LeTclBridge - where a naive caller splitting on whitespace would then
# see a literal, wrong leading backslash). `join`'s output has no such

# `tokens`/`property_names` each independently collapse from "a list" to

# distinguish a single bare token/name from a one-element list of them
# (`terminal:IN0` literal and a one-match [get_terminals] result are
# structurally identical), so this is the only rule that can match every
# one of UPDATES.md item 19.2's own worked examples:
#   get_properties [get_terminals]              -> list of dicts (many tokens)
#   get_properties terminal:IN0 .name           -> scalar (one token, one name)
#   get_properties terminal:IN0 {.name .direction} -> flat list (one token, many names)
#   get_properties [get_terminals] {.name .direction} -> list of flat lists
#
# Each requested property name is a dotted path (`.name`, or chained
# through a hop like `.terminal.name` - backend/src/database/filter.hpp's
# parse_property_path/resolve_property_path grammar, the same one -filter
# expressions already use for their own field paths) resolved via the
# token's own *_property_path shim function - always through this path
# mechanism, even for a plain single-segment name, rather than a separate
# dict-lookup fast path, so chained and unchained lookups behave
# identically. A path that fails to parse or references an unrecognized
# field/hop pushes a message (see le_message_*) that this detects via a
# message_count before/after diff and re-raises as a Tcl error, naming
# the specific problem - a structurally valid path that simply has no
# data for this object (e.g. a list hop with zero elements) pushes no
# message and just resolves to "".
