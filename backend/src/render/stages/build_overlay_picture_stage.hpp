    /// draw_cursor), a hovered shape's yellow outline (see
    /// draw_hover_outline), and the live ruler ghost segment trailing
    /// from an active (unfinished) ruler in Ruler mode (UPDATES.md item
    /// 13, see draw_ruler_segment) - into its own small SkPicture,
    /// cached independently of the (potentially design-sized, expensive)
    /// design picture - keyed on viewport_version()/visibility_version()
    /// (grid spacing lives there), mouse_version(), and ruler_version(),
    /// deliberately *not* AbstractId or selection_version(): this
    /// overlay is a pure viewport/mouse/live-ruler concern, not design
    /// or selection content, so switching Abstracts or changing the
    /// selection doesn't need to recompute it. ruler_version() is
    /// included (unlike a pure mouse concern would need) because the
    /// ghost segment's anchor is the active ruler's *last committed*
    /// point, which changes on click, not mouse move - without this key
    /// the ghost would render stale for one frame after a click with no
    /// subsequent mouse move, and wouldn't disappear immediately when a
    /// ruler finishes (e.g. via double-click) with no mouse movement.
    /// Selected-piece outlines and finalized rulers are each a separate
    /// picture (see BuildSelectionOverlayPictureStage/
    /// BuildRulerOverlayPictureStage) precisely so a mouse move alone
    /// never has to re-walk the selection list or every ruler's tick
    /// geometry - see those classes' own comments for why those splits
    /// exist. Root of its own chain - reads Scene's drag/cursor/hover/
    /// ruler state directly, no upstream Renderer stage to compose from.
